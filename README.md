# Project Name: York Develops Flask App

## Description
This application is a Flask-based web project designed with a focus on simplicity, modularity, and ease of expansion. It's structured to serve as a robust starting point for further development, whether for a personal project, educational purposes, or as a foundation for a more complex web application.

### Key Features and Structure:
- **Flask Framework**: The app utilizes Flask, a lightweight and flexible micro web framework for Python. Flask is known for its simplicity and fine-grained control, making it an excellent choice for both small-scale applications and complex web services.
- **Basic Routing and Views**: The application includes basic routing that handles HTTP requests and serves web pages. Initially, it has a simple 'Hello World' route, and a main hub or welcome page as the central point of interaction.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript Integration**: The front end is built using standard web technologies - HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for client-side interactivity. This setup is further enhanced with Bootstrap, a widely-used CSS framework, to ensure a responsive and modern user interface.
- **SQLAlchemy for Database Interactions**: SQLAlchemy, a SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library for Python, is integrated for handling database operations. It provides a full suite of tools for working with databases in a Pythonic manner.
- **Project Organization**: The app follows a structured approach, with separate directories for templates (HTML files), static files (CSS, JavaScript, and images), and application logic (Python files). This modular structure aids in maintaining a clean codebase.
- **Development and Debugging Features**: Running in development mode, the app offers detailed error logs and an interactive debugger, making it easier to identify and resolve issues during development.

### Current State:
As of now, the application is in its initial stages with a basic setup:
- A minimal Flask setup capable of serving web pages.
- A simple 'Hello World' route and a basic main hub/welcome page.
- Basic integration of HTML/CSS with Bootstrap for frontend styling.
- A preliminary setup for SQLAlchemy, though specific database models and interactions may still need to be defined.
- A project structure primed for expansion into more complex features and functionalities.
